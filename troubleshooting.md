# Troubleshooting/FAQ
## The Map doesn't move/points in the wrong place
*   Make sure you haven't switched into manual mode.
*   Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up here: http://www.gsmarena.com/
*   Try calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI.
*   Are there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass? <br />
*   Try switching off "magnetic correction" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.

## Why is autolocation not supported for my phone?
*    In Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described in https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m

## The Map is jittery
*    If you have a phone that lacks a gyro then some jitter is to be expected. Try adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings).

## Do I need an internet connection?
*    No, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one. You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.

## Can I help test the latest features?
*    Sure! Join our [beta testing program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.stardroid) and get the latest version.
