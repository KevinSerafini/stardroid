# Implementing ISS Tracking

Much asked for feature (e.g. https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid/issues/318)

To do it properly would like to revamp the datamodel and the GUI (certainly before we support many more satellites). But should be straightforward to do something
simple in the meantime.
