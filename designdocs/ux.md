# Overall UX
## Random feature ideas
* Do away with the initial splash screen (except maybe on first run?)
* Start outside of the celestial sphere and fly forwards into it
* Have different astronomical bodies at different radii - maybe this could be used to account for slight differences in parallax depending on place on Earth
* Fly to other locations? Be on the moon looking back at Earth?
* Touch an object for more information (obviously)
* Configurable UI to account for accessibility preferences
* Remove likely underused features like layers from the main UI
* Can you find a more intuitive way to switch to manual mode?
* Compass compensation
* Camera mode
* Notifications
* Set/rise times
* OTA updates
* Real horizon
*
